bugs

 ragdoll.
When the player turns into a ragdoll the ragdoll becomes jittery and will likely fall off the map.
Which you can still turn back into a player but however if the ragdoll body goes far away, well then your invisible.

The one other bug is the plateform.
Not really a bug. Has something to do with the players mass but sometimes it will break will you ride it.
